# Overview

## About the project

I was provided with a design mockup as a [PDF-file](https://github.com/dalex01/frontend-nanodegree-portfolio/blob/master/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) (here is [mockup in jpg](https://github.com/dalex01/frontend-nanodegree-portfolio/blob/master/mockup.jpg)) and should replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I develop a responsive website that display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Requirements
